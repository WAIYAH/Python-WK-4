# Python-WK-4
Python script for file handling and exception handling: reads a file, writes a modified version, and handles errors by prompting for a filename.

# File Handling and Exception Handling Assignment

## Overview
This repository contains a Python program for the "File Read & Write Challenge." The program reads a file, modifies its content (converts it to uppercase), and writes the result to a new file. It includes exception handling to manage errors, such as when a file cannot be found or read, by prompting the user for a valid filename.

## Files
- `file-handler.py`: The main Python script that performs file reading, modification, and writing with error handling.
- `sample.txt`: A sample input file to test the program.

## How to Run
1. Ensure `sample.txt` (or another text file) is in the same directory as `file-handler.py`.
2. Run the script in a terminal:
   - On Windows: `python file-handler.py`
   - On Mac/Linux: `python3 file-handler.py`
3. When prompted, enter the filename (e.g., `sample.txt`).
4. The program will create a new file (e.g., `modified_sample.txt`) with the modified content.

## Features
- Reads a user-specified text file.
- Handles errors like missing files or read/write issues gracefully.
- Modifies content (converts to uppercase) and writes to a new file.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
